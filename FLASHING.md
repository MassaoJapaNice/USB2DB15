## 3. Connecting the FTDI Programmer

1. Connect the programmer to the USB2DB15 as illustrated. Remember, TX (Transmit) from one device connects to RX (Receive) on the other.

| USB FTDI Programmer      | USB2DB15    |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| VCC                      | VCC         |
| GND                      | GND         |
| TXD                      | RX          |
| RXD                      | TX          |
| RTS/DTR                  | DTR         |
| CTS                      | Unused      |

2. If your programmer has a jumper for using 5V or 3.3V, set it to 5V. The USB2DB15 will be powered by the programmer while flashing the software. Plug in the USB programmer.
